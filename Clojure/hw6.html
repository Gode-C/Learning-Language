<title> CSci 2014 - Homework 6</title>


<h1> Homework 6 -- due Wednesday April 20 </h1>

<h4> Important reminders</h4>
<ul>
<li> You need to write your code into a file and upload the file.
You can read your code from a file into clojure by using (load-file
"myfile.clj"), where myfile.clj is the name of your file and your file is in
the directory from which you start clojure.
The TAs will run your code on additional test cases.

</li><li> Use the following convention for the name of the file you will
submit:  start with the word "sec" followed by
the non-zero part of your section number, followed by -, and
the homework number.  For instance, for this homework,
if you are in section 002 you will use 
<code>sec2-hw6.clj</code>.
Do not include your name. When assignments are dowloaded from
Moodle your name is added to the front of the file name you used.

</li><li> Submit ONLY plain text files. Make sure the file you submit can be loaded
in clojure with no errors if you want to receive any credit. Use exactly
the names we specify for the functions with the same arguments.
You do not need to submit results of running your program.
</li></ul>

<h3> Extracting information from the log file of a WWW server </h3>

For this homework you will use a large log file, "NASA_access_log_Jul95_short",
and extract informatiom from it using regular expressions.
This file (which is ~100MB) contain about half a month worth of all HTTP requests 
to the NASA Kennedy Space Center WWW server in Florida.  


<h4>Description of the file contents</h4>

The requests to the server are recorded in an ASCII file, one line per request, 
with the following structure:
<ul>
<li>  host making the request. A hostname when possible, otherwise the
  Internet address if the name could not be looked up.
</li><li>  timestamp in the format [03/Jul/1995:10:47:48 -0400]
   "DD/MON/YYYY:HH:MM:SS" where DD is the day of the month, MON is the name
   of the month, YYYY is the year, HH:MM:SS is the time of day using a
   24-hour clock, and the timezone is -0400.
</li><li>   request given in double quotes.
</li><li>   HTTP response code.
</li><li>   number of bytes in the reply.
</li></ul>

The HTTP response codes and their meanings are part of Hypertext Transfer Protocol
-- HTTP/1.1 (https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html):
<br>
The first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response. The last
two digits do not have any categorization role. There are 5 values for the
first digit:
<ul>
<li> 1xx: Informational - Request received, continuing process
</li><li> 2xx: Success - The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted
</li><li> 3xx: Redirection - Further action must be taken in order to complete the request
</li><li> 4xx: Client Error - The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
</li><li> 5xx: Server Error - The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request
</li></ul>

The second to last field in each log contains the status code returned by the
server for the request. For example, the first
line of the file contains 200 for the status and therefore, indicates that the
request was carried out by the server successfully.


<h3>What to do:</h3>

<ol>
<li> Get from github the file "NASA_access_log_Jul95_short", by doing
<pre>git pull
</pre>
and place it in the directory where you have your working copies of the
files you got from git.

</li><li> Read line by line the file NASA_access_log_Jul95_short you got from git.

</li><li> Write clojure clode to answer the following questions. You should
use regex, but you can use as many other functions as you want.

<ol>
<li> How many requests were made without a hostname, i.e., from an IP address
   of the format [0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]?


</li><li> Find in the file all the requests that were made from a private IP address.
<br>
A private IP address is an address that is reserved for special uses cases. 
Examples of reserved IP address ranges are: 
<br><code>
127.0.0.0-127.255.255.255</code>: Reserved for loopback and private network use only.
<br> <code>
10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255:</code>  Reserved for private network use only.
<br> <code>
192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255:</code>  Reserved for private network use only.
<br> <code>
192.88.99.0-192.88.99.255: </code> Reserved for IPv6 to IPv4 relay use only. 
</li><li> Using the timestamp shown earlier as the format used in the web server logs,
     find the number of requests that were made on the 4th and 5th of July.
</li><li> Find the distinct hosts that made requests between 10:00pm and 10.30pm on 
     the 5th of July. <font color="red"> The function mame specified, (count-hosts),
     seems to indicate we want the number of hosts, but the question asks for the 
     distinct hosts. Please return the distinct hosts. For the time window you can 
     end it at 10:29 and leave out 10:30</font>.
</li><li> Find all the requests that were not successful, i.e., resulted in a server 
     error (5xx).
</li><li> <font color="red">Count</font> all the requests that were redirected, 
     i.e., resulted in the response code 3xx.
</li><li> <font color="red">Count</font> all requests that sent more than 
     50000 bytes in the response.
</li></ol>
</li></ol>

<h3> <font color="red">Comments and additional specifications </font></h3>

<ol>
<li> Do not slurp the file but read it line by line, as specified in
     step 2.  Reading the file in a single step does not scale to huge
     files, so you need to learn how to read line by line.  We have
     shown how to do it in a lab.
</li><li> When you read one line, you need to decide what to do with that line.  
     There are at least two different ways of thinking about how to
     structure your program:
     <ul> <li>you write one function for each of the seven things you 
     need to extract from the file.  Each function will open the file,
     read one line at a time, use an appropriate regex, and return the
     value computed for each question.  Please remember that printing
     the result is not sufficient, you need to return the value.
     Printing is just a side effect.
     </li><li> you read all the lines and save them into a big vector.
     You then call individual functions, one for each of the things
     you need to extract from the file.  In this case, the file is read
     once and its contents are stored in memory.  This approach is not 
     as scalable but it is fine. When you write the separate functions.
     the function will use the strings in the vector instead of reading
     it from the file.
     </li></ul>
</li><li> To allow for different ways of doing things, the functions to use
     for computing on each line will not take any argument.  If you write 
     functions that read the file, you should hard code the file name 
     in the functions.
     If you write functions to operate on the lines you have saved in a big
     vector, then hard code in the functions the global variable where 
     you saved the lines from the file.  Hope this is clear.  If not, 
     please use the class forum.
     <p> Here are the function names to use:
     <br> <tt> (count-IP)</tt>
     <br> <tt> (find-private-IP)</tt>
     <br> <tt> (count-request-on-dates)</tt>
     <br> <tt> (count-hosts)</tt>
     <br> <tt> (find-server-error)</tt>
     <br> <tt> (count-redirect)</tt>.  We replaced the original question
     of finding with counting to make things easier, since there are a 
     lot of these requests.
     <br> <tt> (count-morethan50000)</tt>.  We replaced the original 
     question of finding with counting to make things easier, since 
     there are many these requests.
</p></li><li> for the IP addresses in the file, they are all correct, so you do 
     no need to check that each number is in the 0 to 255 range.  You
     need to just check the number of digits in each part is beween 1 and
     3, and the numbers of separated by a period.
</li><li> there are no private IP addresses in the file we have given to you.
     There were some of them in the rest of the log file that we did not
     give to you because it was too big. 
     Here are a few lines. The first one has a private address, 
     192.168.X.X is private. The other lines do not have private addresses.
     192.88.99.X is private but 192.88.13.248 is not. Also 192.112.227.51
     is not private.
     <pre>192.168.2.7 - - [19/Jul/1995:00:29:42 -0400] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 7071
192.88.13.248 - - [17/Jul/1995:18:25:01 -0400] "GET /ksc.html HTTP/1.0" 200 7071
192.112.227.51 - - [01/Jul/1995:00:52:39 -0400] "GET /shuttle/countdown/liftoff.html HTTP/1.0" 200 4538
</pre>
     Make sure your program can detect them, because we will check that your
     program can correctly identify them.
</li></ol>

<h3> Bonus question </h3> (up to 10 points)

For this question you will work with an inverted index to be used to search in
a set of dovuments (or files).
An index is a list of documents and which words appear in them. 
An inverted index is a list of words and the documents in which they appear. 
<ol>
<li> Write your own inverted index or create it using the functions 
provided at
(a href="https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Inverted_index#Clojure"
https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Inverted_index#Clojure.
<br>
Use the files a, b, c from git (<font color="red&quot;">they have been
added)</font> or select your own files, by calling
<tt>(make-index (list "a" "b" "c"))</tt>. 
</li><li> Suppose you have the inverted index constructed from the set of
files a, b, and c. You now have a new file, d, that you want to use 
to extend the inverted index.  
<br> Write a function <tt>(extend invindex file)</tt> 
to extend the existing
inverted index by including the new words from file d, and to update 
appropriately the words that were already in the inverted index and 
are also in file d.
