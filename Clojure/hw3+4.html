<title> CSci 2014 - Homework 3+4</title>


<h1> Homework 3+4 -- due Wednesday March 9 </h1>

<h4> Important reminders</h4>
<ul>
<li> You need to write your code into a file and upload the file.
You can read your code from a file into clojure by using (load-file
"myfile.clj"), where myfile.clj is the name of your file and your file is in
the directory from which you start clojure.
The TAs will run your code on additional test cases.

</li><li> Use the following convention for the name of the file you will
submit:  start with the word "sec" followed by
the non-zero part of your section number, followed by -, and
the homework number.  For instance, for this homework,
if you are in section 002 you will use 
<code>sec2-hw4.clj</code> or
<code>sec2-hw3+4.clj</code>.
Do not include your name. When assignments are dowloaded from
Moodle your name is added to the front of the file name you used.

</li><li> Submit ONLY plain text files. Make sure the file you submit can be loaded
in clojure with no errors if you want to receive any credit. Use exactly
the names we specify for the functions with the same arguments.
You do not need to submit results of running your program.
</li></ul>

This homework will take you through the steps of doing RSA encryption.
For this homework you will use some of the functions you wrote
in previous labs and use the code you cloned from GitHub. 
You need to update the files from GitHub by first doing <tt> cd to the 
directory where you cloned from GitHub</tt> and then
<pre>git pull
</pre>
The file <tt>modular-inverse.clj</tt> has been updated.

<p>
RSA is a public-key cryptosystem which uses a public encryption key
and a secret decryption key.  Here are the steps:

</p><ol>
<li> (14 points) Key generation<br>

RSA uses 4 numbers, called <tt>p, q, d, e</tt>, chosen so that

    <tt>(m^e)^d mod n = m </tt>

<br> <tt>p</tt> and <tt>q</tt> must be large prime numbers, similar 
in magnitude.
<br> It is important to choose <tt>p</tt> and <tt>q</tt> so that 
<tt>(p-1)</tt> and <tt>(q-1)</tt> are
strong primes, i.e. <tt>(p-1)/2, (q-1)/2</tt> are also prime.
<p> For this assignment we give you the two numbers <tt>p</tt> 
and <tt>q</tt>, so you will not have to select them.  Add these
lines to your file:
</p><pre>(def p 6240322667N)    ; need long integer
(def q 6240323147N)    ; need long integer
</pre>
From <tt>p</tt> and <tt>q</tt> you have to compute two new numbers <br>
  <tt> n = p*q <br>
  m = (p-1)* (q-1)</tt>

<p> The next number, <tt>e</tt>, has to be <tt>1 &lt; e &lt; <font color="red">m
</font></tt> and
has to be relatively prime with <tt>m</tt>, i.e <tt>gcd(e,m)=1</tt>.

<br>There is a unique number <tt>d</tt> that is the modular multiplicative 
inverse of <tt>e</tt>, i.e <tt>d*e mod m = 1</tt>.
<br> There are many <tt>e</tt> that satisfy the requirements.
</p><p>
Write a function <tt>(find-e m)</tt> to find a value for <tt>e</tt>.
<br>
The function should guess a value for <tt>e</tt>, and see if there is
a modular inverse for it. If there is, then <tt>e</tt> is a valid number
for RSA.
</p><p>
Assign to <tt>d</tt> the value of <tt>(modular-inverse e <font color="red">m
</font></tt> ).

<br> At the end of this step, you will have the four numbers that RSA needs.

</p></li><li> (6 points) Key distribution. <br>
<tt>n</tt> and <tt>e</tt> are the public key.   
<tt>n</tt> is called the modulus, <tt>e</tt> the public exponent.
<br> <tt>n</tt> and <tt>d</tt> are the private key.  
Never divulge your <tt>d</tt> and your <tt>p</tt> and <tt>q</tt>.

<p>To simplify the use of the public key, write a constructor <br>
<tt>(make-public-key n e)</tt> <br>
to create a data structure where you will keep the two parts of the public key <br>
and write two selectors, <br>
<tt>(public-mod publickey)</tt>
and <tt>(public-exp publickey)</tt> <br> 
to return each of them.  
This way you will use the selectors to access the two parts of the 
data structure and your choice of data structure will not affect 
any other function.</p><p>

</p></li><li> (25 points) Encryption of a word. <br> 

A number is encrypted using the public key as<br>
  <tt>cyphernumber = plainnumber^e mod n</tt>,<br>
where <tt>plainnumber</tt> is the unencrypted number, 
and <tt>cyphernumber</tt> is the encrypted number. 
The number to be encrypted has to be <tt> &lt; n</tt>.
<br> Write the function <tt>(encrypt-num number publickey)</tt> 

<p>A word is encrypted by first converting it 
to a number which is then encrypted.  
<br> To convert a word to a number you can modify
the functions <tt>string-&gt;ascii</tt> and <tt>ascii-num96</tt> 
you wrote for homework 2 to use as base 91 instead than 96 (this
will not include the ascii characters that come after z).

</p><p> Next you need to write the function 
<tt>(encrypt-word plaintext publickey)</tt>
to encrypt a word by transforming it into a number and encrypting it.
<br> It should work like this:
</p><pre>user=&gt; (encrypt-word "void" public-key)
25473882069401110051N
user=&gt; (encrypt-word "gini" public-key)
20648268134717579244N
</pre>
Finally, use your your function to encrypt your x500  (just the id, not the @ part otherwise 
it is too long), as in the example above.
<p>
</p></li><li> (15 points) Decryption of a word. <br>
The original message <tt>plaintext</tt> can be recovered from 
<tt>cyphertext</tt> by computing
<br> <tt> cyphertext^d mod n</tt>, <br>which is the same as
<tt>(plaintext^e mode n)^d mod n</tt>

<br> For this you need to write the function
<tt>(decrypt-word cyphertext privatekey)</tt>
<br> It should work like this:
<pre>user=&gt; (decrypt-word 25473882069401110051N private-key)
"void"
user=&gt; (decrypt-word 20648268134717579244N private-key)
"gini"
</pre>

</li><li> (25 points) Encryption of a sentence. <br> 

For this part you can use <tt>partition-by</tt> to break the sentence
into individual words, which you can then convert to numbers and encrypt.
<br>For instance, if you want to break the string on blank spaces, do: <br>
<pre>user=&gt; (partition-by (fn[x] (= x \space)) "lisp lovers get garbage collected")
((\l \i \s \p) (\space) (\l \o \v \e \r \s) (\space) (\g \e \t) (\space) (\g \a \r \b \a \g \e) (\space) (\c \o \l \l \e \c \t \e \d))
</pre>
<br>
You can use any other method of your own choice to break the sentence into
parts. The only requirement is that no part can be longer than 10 letters/digits
ond no punctuation, otherwise the number produced by converting to a number is 
<tt>&gt; n</tt> and will break the process.

<p> Write the function <tt>(encrypt-msg msg publickey)</tt>

</p><p> Try your function on the following sentences: 
<br> "c lovers do not die they get cast into void"
<br> "lisp lovers get garbage collected" 
<br> a sentence of your own choice with at least 6 words (no word can be longer
than 10 letters/digits and no punctuation)
</p><p>
</p></li><li> (15 points) Decryption of a sentence.
<br>Decrypt a message written as a list of encrypted chunks, by decrypting each
into an integer, converting to a string, and returning a string with
all the decrypted parts. If your encryption did not include blank spaces between
words you need to add the blank spaces back.

<p> Write the function <tt>(decrypt-msg msg privatekey)</tt>

</p><p> As an example, here is the encryption I am getting:
</p><pre>user=&gt; (encrypt-msg "lisp lovers get garbage collected" public-key)
(9746835113510272068N 0N 31010268053637348251N 0N 209917131241031144N 0N 23415676707122335067N 0N 2488092978978861211N)
user=&gt; (decrypt-msg '(9746835113510272068N 0N 31010268053637348251N 0N 209917131241031144N 0N 23415676707122335067N 0N 2488092978978861211N) 
  private-key)
"lisp lovers get garbage collected"
</pre>
</li></ol>

(10 points) Bonus question <br>

RSA can also be used to verify that a message was sent from a specific person.  
Here is how it works.
<br> Alice encrypts a word <tt>plaintext</tt> using her private key, i.e. by computing 
<tt>cyphertext=plaintext^d mod n</tt> and sends it to Bob. 
<br> When Bob gets it decrypts it with the public key of Alice, i.e.
computes <tt>(cyphertext^e mod n)</tt>.
<br> If he gets back <tt>plaintext</tt> he knows the sender used 
Alice private key.
<p> Write a function <tt>(encrypt-val w key)&gt;/tt&gt; and the opposite function
<tt>(decrypt-val c key)</tt>.
They should work like this:
</tt></p><pre><tt>user=&gt; (encrypt-val "maria" private-key)
35069910769087591972N
user=&gt; (decrypt-val 35069910769087591972N public-key)
"maria"
</tt></pre><tt>
