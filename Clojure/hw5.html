<title> CSci 2014 - Homework 5</title>


<h1> Homework 5 -- due Wednesday March 30 </h1>

<h4> Important reminders</h4>
<ul>
<li> You need to write your code into a file and upload the file.
You can read your code from a file into clojure by using (load-file
"myfile.clj"), where myfile.clj is the name of your file and your file is in
the directory from which you start clojure.
The TAs will run your code on additional test cases.

</li><li> Use the following convention for the name of the file you will
submit:  start with the word "sec" followed by
the non-zero part of your section number, followed by -, and
the homework number.  For instance, for this homework,
if you are in section 002 you will use 
<code>sec2-hw5.clj</code>.
Do not include your name. When assignments are dowloaded from
Moodle your name is added to the front of the file name you used.

</li><li> Submit ONLY plain text files. Make sure the file you submit can be loaded
in clojure with no errors if you want to receive any credit. Use exactly
the names we specify for the functions with the same arguments.
You do not need to submit results of running your program.

<h3> Two-player normal form games</h3>

For this homework you will write a program to play a tournament
of the Prisoner Dilemma game.  We first explain what two-player normal 
form games are and how they are played. The homework specifies
what to do at a high level. We specify only the name of the
function to play a game tournament. The choice of how to write
the strategies, represent the history of the plays, store the
gane matrix, etc are left to you.
<p>
(Problem description taken in part from https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/psets/ps4prs/readme.html)
<br>
A prisoner's dilemma is an example of a two-player normal form game.
It involves two players. Each has a choice
between <i>cooperating</i> and <i>defecting</i>. If the two players
cooperate, they each do moderately well; if they both defect, they
each do moderately poorly. If one player cooperates and the other
defects, then the defector does very well and the cooperator does
very poorly. 
</p><p>
In game theory, a <i>two-player normal form game</i> is represented
as a two-by-two matrix, as shown in the table. 
The two players are called A and B, and
the choices are called ``cooperate'' and ``defect.''

</p><center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tbody><tr><td>            </td><td>B cooperates</td><td>B defects</td></tr>
<tr><td>A cooperates</td><td>5 5</td><td> 2 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>A defects   </td><td>3 2</td><td> 1 1</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
Players A and B play a single game by separately (and
secretly) choosing to either cooperate or defect. Once each player has
made a choice, he announces it to the other player; and the two then
collect their respective scores in the game matrix.  Each entry in the
matrix is a pair of numbers indicating a score for each player,
depending on their choices. Thus, in the example, if Player A
chooses to cooperate while Player B defects, then A gets 2
points and B gets 3 points. If both players defect, they each
get 1 point. Note, by the way, that the game matrix is a matter of
public knowledge; for instance, Player A knows before the game
even starts that if he and B both choose to defect, they will
each get 1 point.
</p><p>
In an <i>iterated game</i>, the two players play repeatedly: thus,
after finishing one game,  A and B may play another.
(Admittedly, there is a little confusion in the terminology here: you
can think of each individual game as a single ``round'' of the larger,
iterated game.) There are a number of ways in which iterated games may
be played; in the simplest situation, A and B play for
some fixed number of rounds (say, 200), and before each round they are
able to look at the record of all previous rounds. For instance,
before playing the tenth round of their iterated game, both A
and B are able to study the results of the previous nine rounds.
</p><p>
This type of game is a particularly easy one to analyze.
Let's examine the situation from Player A's point of view
(Player B's point of view is identical):
``Suppose  B cooperates. Then I do better by cooperating
myself (I receive 5 points instead of 3). On the other
hand, suppose B defects. I still do better by cooperating
(since I get 2 points instead of 1). So no matter what
B does, I am better off cooperating.''
Player B will, of course, reason the same way, and both will
choose to cooperate. In the terminology of game theory, both A
and B have a <i>dominant</i> choice --- i.e., a choice that gives
a preferred outcome no matter what the other player chooses to do.
This example does not represent a prisoner's dilemma
situation, since when both players make their dominant choice, they
also both achieve their highest personal scores.  We'll see an example
of a prisoner's dilemma game very shortly.
<br>
To recap: with thegiven gme matrix we
would expect both players to cooperate; and in an iterated game, we would
expect both players to cooperate repeatedly, on every round.

</p><h3>The Prisoner's Dilemma Game Matrix</h3>

Consider the game matrix shown here:

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tbody><tr><td>            </td><td>B cooperates</td><td>B defects</td></tr>
<tr><td>A cooperates</td><td> 3 3</td><td> 0 5 </td></tr>
<tr><td>A defects   </td><td> 5 0</td><td> 1 1 </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
In this case, Players A and B both have a dominant
choice---namely, defection. No matter what Player B does,
Player A improves his own score by defecting, and vice versa.
However, there is something odd about this game. It seems as though
the two players would benefit by choosing to cooperate. Instead of
winning only one point each, they could win three points each.  So the
``rational'' choice of mutual defection has a puzzling
self-destructive flavor.
</p><p>
To formalize the situation, let CC be the number
of points won by each player when they both cooperate; let DD be
the number of points won when both defect; let CD be the number
of points won by the cooperating party when the other defects; and let
DC be the number of points won by the defecting party when the
other cooperates. Then the prisoner's dilemma situation is
characterized by the following conditions:

</p><pre>DC &gt; CC &gt; DD &gt; CD 
CC &gt; (DC + CD) / 2
</pre>

In the last game matrix, we have:

<pre>DC = 5 
CC = 3
DD = 1 
CD = 0
</pre>

These values satisfy the prisoner's dilemma conditions.

<p>In the late 1970's, political scientist Robert Axelrod held a computer
tournament designed to investigate the prisoner's dilemma
situation. The rules and results are described in Axelrod's book 
"The Evolution of Cooperation".  
</p><h3>What to do:</h3>

<ol>
<li> Write a function, <tt>(compete-n-times strategy1 strategy2 n)</tt> 
to play two ``strategies'' against one another
for n games, where n is a parameter you pass to the function, and print 
out the scores for each of the two players.
<p>
We suggest to represent the
player strategies as procedures. Each strategy should take
two inputs --- its own ``history'' (that is, a list of all its
previous ``plays'') and its opponent's ``history.'' The strategy
should returns either the symbol <tt>c</tt> for ``cooperate'' or the symbol
<tt>d</tt> for ``defect''.
<br>
At the beginning of an iterated game, each history is empty.
As the game progresses, the histories grow by adding
<tt>c</tt>'s and <tt>d</tt>'s. Note how each strategy should 
have its own history as its first input. <i>[Hint: use an atom to
store the history, so in each round it can be updated.]</i>
</p><p>
The values from the game matrix should be stored in a global variable
and used to calculate the scores for each game.  This way the values
in the game matrix can be changed without having to change anything
else.
<br>
At the end of the tournament the scores of each player have to be 
printed.  The total determines the winner of the tournament.
</p></li><li>
Implement these strategies for the iterated prisoner's
dilemma game:
<ul>
<li>All-Defect.
A program using the <i>all-defect</i> strategy simply defects on
every round of every game.
</li><li>All-Cooperate.
A program using the <i>all-cooperate</i> strategy cooperates
on every round of every game.
</li><li>Random.
A program using the <i>random</i> strategy cooperates or defects on 
a random basis.
</li><li>Tit-for-Tat.
This program cooperates on the first round, and then on every subsequent
round it mimics the other player's previous move. Thus, if the other
player cooperates (defects) on the n-th round, then <i>tit-for-tat</i>
will cooperate (defect) on the (n + 1)-th round.
</li></ul>

All these strategies are extremely simple. The first three
do not even pay any attention to the other player; their responses are
uninfluenced by the previous rounds of the game.  Nevertheless,
simplicity is not necessarily a disadvantage.  Rapoport's first-prize
program employed the <i>tit-for-tat</i> strategy, and achieved the
highest average score in a field of far more complicated programs.
</li><li>
Play games among the four strategies defined above, pairing them in
all possible ways.  For each pair of strategies run a tournament of
100 games.  

Notice how a strategy's performance varies depending on its
opponent.  For example, <tt> all-cooperate</tt> does well
against <tt>tit-for-tat</tt> or against another <tt> all-cooperate</tt>,
but it loses badly to <tt> all-defect</tt>.  Notice how <tt>
tit-for-tat</tt> never beats its opponent --- but it never
loses badly.
</li></ol>

<h3> Bonus question </h3> (up to 10 points)

Write a strategy <tt> tit-for-two-tats</tt>. The strategy should always
cooperate unless the opponent defected on both of the previous two
rounds, or, equivalently, <tt> tit-for-two-tats</tt> should cooperate if
the opponent cooperated on either of the previous two rounds. 
Play <tt> tit-for-two-tats</tt> against other strategies.
