Answer the questions below according to the lab specification. Write
your answers directly in this text file and submit it to complete Lab01.


Problem 1: Client Socket Setup
==============================

  Identify the main steps for a C program to set up a "client" socket
  which will communicate with remote machine which has a known open port
  and exchange information.



    getaddrinfo() -> create socket -> connect ->  write/read 


Problem 2: Server Socket Setup
==============================

  Identify the main steps for a C program to set up a "server" socket
  which will listen for connections from remote machine.

    getaddrinfo -> create socket -> bind -> listen ->  accept(client connection)
    -> write/read



Problem 3: Private Messages
===========================

  Consider the addition of private messages to the blather
  server/client.  This feature would allow a user to type a message like
  ,----
  | Bruce>> @Lois I know Clark's alter ego
  `----
  and have it only delivered to the user specified with the @ symbol,
  Lois in this case, rather than have the message broadcast to all
  users. Only on the screen of Lois and Bruce would appear the private
  message delivery:
  ,----
  | [Private: Bruce @ Lois] : I know Clark's alter ego
  `----
  All other users would not see this message.

  Discuss the alterations to server and client that would be required to
  implement this feature. Include in your description.
  1. Any additional data types or alterations to existing data types
  
    mesg_t need a new .kind of private message.
    kind_t need a new .to_name for reveiever of private message.
  
  2. Any additional FIFOs or protocol alterations
  
    no
  
  3. Changes required for bl-client to implement private messages
  
    ckeck input when creating messages, private if has @someone.
    create private message and send to server.
    when reveieve private, print the sender name.
  
  4. Changes required for bl-server to implement private messages

    when receieve private messages, only send to the client involved.


Problem 4: mmap()
=================

  Describe briefly what mmap() does and how it may be used to simplify
  file I/O operations significantly.
  
    mmap() creates a new mapping in the virtual address space.
        it can assign a region of virtual address space corresponding to file
        content. 
    -the the whole file is accessible, no need to worry about read() or
        buffer bull.
    -less system calls, like read() or write().
    -if multiple process are accessing the same file, they could share the
        physical space.
    -less copying
