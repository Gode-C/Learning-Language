Problem 1 `http-get.c'
======================

  Examine the source code for `http-get.c' and use it to contact a few
  hosts and files such as those shown at the top of the source.  Answer
  the following questions.


A
~

  - What is the full name of the that protocol is being employed?
  - Which port does the server listen on in this protocol?

    
    http = http
    port = 80


B
~

  Describe which system calls are used to find an internet address,
  create a socket, and connect the socket to the found address.

    find internet address:
        getaddrinfo()
    creat socket:
        socket()
    connect socket
        connect()


C
~

  In this protocol, which entity, SERVER or CLIENT, sends data first?
  (Though you don't have access to a server code, this should be obvious
  from the structure of the client code).


    client send data first

D
~

  Does the protocol work in plain text (human readable) or in binary
  format (harder for humans to read directly).  Show examples/evidence
  to support your answer.

    plain text,
    we can read it when it print the response.
    Header also tells by: Content-Type: text/plain

    
E
~

  Many protocols use /headers/ which are meant to convey information
  between the communication programs about the state of the
  communication but are NOT data that a program user would be interested
  in.  Show a few headers which appear in communication and describe
  what you infer their meaning to be.

    source port number and destination port number is included in the header.
    protocol, date, content-length are also showing in the header. They are
    pretty much means by their name.

F

  Attempting to hunt down the actual homepage for the UMN via
  ,----
  | ./http-get twin-cities.umn.edu /
  `----
  will produce an interesting conundrum: the address to be contacted to
  retrieve the file uses a DIFFERENT PROTOCOL.

  Identify this other protocol, the port its servers use, and why it
  would be much more complex to write a client to use it.
  
  protocol=https
  port=443
  encrypt the messages send and recieve by client and server.
